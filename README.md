# Simulation-of-Multipurpose-Autonomous-Navigation-Drone-for-Industrial-Use-in-ROS
In inventory applications, drones play a major role to detect the types of objects by using the various applications of computer vision technology. In this paper, we have simulated the smart autonomous drone for decoding of QR Codes along with object detection. Moreover, this drone can detect the obstacle and avoid it when doing a preplanned mission. Gazebo and ROS are the major open-source tools that helps to demonstrate the simulation. First, we will setup the necessary environment by integration and communication between all the individual tools. To make the drone collision free, avoidance system will be initiated, then we will publish the image topic that will be subscribed by OpenCV and pyzbar libraries to decode the QR Code. Finally, we will setup the YOLO darknet for the object detection.
